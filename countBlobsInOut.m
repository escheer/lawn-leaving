% countBlobsInOut.m
% 04/26/2017
% This function takes in the tracks which have been saved over the course
% of the video and outputs a count of the number of blobs found inside and
% outside the event horizon at every frame. Note that the blobs outside the
% event horizon will be much more reliable than those inside since there
% will be many multiblobs inside. The number of blobs outside can be used
% to calculate an aversion ratio if the total number of animals in the
% video is known.
