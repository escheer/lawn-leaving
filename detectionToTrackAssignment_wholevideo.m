%% Assign Detections to Tracks
% Assigning object detections in the current frame to existing tracks is
% done by minimizing cost. The cost is defined as the negative
% log-likelihood of a detection corresponding to a track.
%
% The algorithm involves two steps:
%
% Step 1: Compute the cost of assigning every detection to each track using
% the |distance| method of the |vision.KalmanFilter| System object(TM). The
% cost takes into account the Euclidean distance between the predicted
% centroid of the track and the centroid of the detection. It also includes
% the confidence of the prediction, which is maintained by the Kalman
% filter. The results are stored in an MxN matrix, where M is the number of
% tracks, and N is the number of detections.
%
% Step 2: Solve the assignment problem represented by the cost matrix using
% the |assignDetectionsToTracks| function. The function takes the cost
% matrix and the cost of not assigning any detections to a track.
%
% The value for the cost of not assigning a detection to a track depends on
% the range of values returned by the |distance| method of the
% |vision.KalmanFilter|. This value must be tuned experimentally. Setting
% it too low increases the likelihood of creating a new track, and may
% result in track fragmentation. Setting it too high may result in a single
% track corresponding to a series of separate moving objects.
%
% The |assignDetectionsToTracks| function uses the Munkres' version of the
% Hungarian algorithm to compute an assignment which minimizes the total
% cost. It returns an M x 2 matrix containing the corresponding indices of
% assigned tracks and detections in its two columns. It also returns the
% indices of tracks and detections that remained unassigned.

% Impose an additional constraint based on absolute euclidean distance --

% the distance between the last centroid position and the detection is over
% a certain distance threshold. the goal is to reduce some ambiguities.
