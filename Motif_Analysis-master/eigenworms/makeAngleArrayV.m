function [angleArray, meanAngles] = makeAngleArrayV(x, y)

%MAKEANGLEARRAY Get tangent angles for each frame of normBlocks and rotate
%               to have zero mean angle
%
%   [ANGLEARRAY, MEANANGLES] = MAKEANGLEARRAY(X, Y)
%
%   Input:
%       x - the x coordinates of the worm skeleton (equivalent to
%           dataBlock{4}(:,1,:)
%       y - the y coordinates of the worm skeleton (equivalent to
%           dataBlock{4}(:,2,:)
%
%   Output:
%       angleArray - a numFrames by numSkelPoints - 1 array of tangent
%                    angles rotated to have mean angle of zero.
%       meanAngles - the average angle that was subtracted for each frame
%                    of the video.
