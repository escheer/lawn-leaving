Start the script: "RunAllSkeletons"
This runs through all 4 codes to get from WormImages to angle time series per track.


to set number of angles:

-> you have to edit variable "numIP" in (2) "correctAngles_JRv1_IH1 in line 32  (or use it as a function)
   numIP = number of wormpoints = number of angles +2  (there are two more wormpoints than angles)
-> you can also edit the smoothing in line 38 if you want



%%% (1)
FindAllWormSkeletonsFromTracks;
%%% Calculates the skeletons from binary worm images from tracks_als files.

%%% (2)
correctAngles;
%%% Smoothes skeleton, divides skeleton into segments of equal arc length
%%% and calculates angles in rad.
%%% Set the number of wormpoints = numIP (number of angles + 2) (line 34);
%%% Optionally, edit smoothpart (line 40), if you want to smooth the
%%% skeleton less or more.

%%% (3)
HeadAssign;
%%% Finds head coordinates of worm

%%%(4)
skel_order;
%%% Orders skeleton from head to tail
%%% and fixes left-right flips. 
%%% Optionally, ajdust thresholds ("threshes" in line 7) in this script for correcting left-right
%%% flips.
